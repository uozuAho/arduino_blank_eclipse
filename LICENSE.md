Arduino source files license
============================

All Arduino source files and libraries are covered by the LGPL (I think). This allows some form
of use within proprietary applications, however I'm not a lawyer and don't understand the 
intricacies. For more info see here: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/FAQ


Other source files license
==========================

I believe in a more free form of freedom than the GPL/LGPL, so all non-Arduino files in this
project are covered by an MIT-ish license (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). In short:

 - You can use these files in any way you like, just give me some credit when you use this project 
   so people know how good I am! (ie. keep any copyright notices in any files intact)
